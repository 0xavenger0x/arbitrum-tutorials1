# eth-deposit Tutorial

`eth-deposit` shows how to move Ether from Ethereum (Layer 1) into the Arbitrum (Layer 2) chain.

## How it works (Under the hood)

---

A user deposits Ether onto Arbitrum using Arbitrum's general L1-to-L2 message passing system, and simply passing the desired Ether as callvalue and no additional data. For more info, see [Retryable Tickets documentation](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/l1_l2_messages#depositing-eth-via-retryables).

## Demos

In this repo we show 3 different examples of how a client may trigger an Ether deposit.

---

#### **1. Directly Through the Inbox Contract**

`Inbox.sol` is an Arbitrum core protocol contract; it includes a `depositEth` method which triggers an L1-to-L2 message that will deposit Ether to the destination address. In this demo, a client connects to this contract directly to trigger their Ether deposit.

See [./exec-viaInbox.js](./scripts/exec-viaInbox.js) for inline explanation.

To run:

```
yarn deposit:inbox
```

---

#### **2. Through an L1 DApp**

[Deposit.sol](./contracts/Deposit.sol) is a contract which itself triggers an Eth deposit. Here we show a client connecting to Deposit.sol and triggering and Eth deposit that way.

See [./exec-viaDapp.js](./scripts/exec-viaDapp.js) for inline explanation.

To run:

```
yarn deposit:dapp
```

---

#### **3. Using arb-ts tooling**

Finally, our [arb-ts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum/tree/master/packages/arb-ts) provides a simply convenience method for depositing Ether, abstracting away the need for the client to connect to any contracts manually.

See [./exec-viaLib.js](./scripts/exec-viaLib.js) for inline explanation.

To run:

```
yarn deposit:arb-ts
```

## Config Environment Variables

Set the values shown in `.env-sample` as environmental variables. To copy it into a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env-sample .env
```

(you'll still need to edit some variables, i.e., `DEVNET_PRIVKEY`)

---

Once the script is successfully executed, you can go to the [Arbitrum block explorer](https://rinkeby-explorer.arbitrum.io/#), enter your address, and see the amount of ETH that has been assigned to your address on the Arbitrum chain!
